	I'm a Lecturer in the Department of English at Stellenbosch University. My research explores the
	confluence of social and ecological issues in literary texts, focusing especially on postcolonial
	writing. Currently, I'm working on a book about alternative temporalities in a range of novels by
	Southern African authors, including ZoÃ« Wicomb, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, Imraan Coovadia, and
	J.M. Coetzee. From time to time I write short stories, and I try to never be too far away from the
	sea.
